Historical Process: Transfer of scientific knowledge (from Muslim text -> Jewish scholar -> Christian king)
The canon of medicine shows knowledge of medicine, networks of exchange, and support of the state.

#### Common Threads:

- Spread of belief systems across trade networks facilitate cross cultural exchanges
- Interactions become more frequent and complex over time (products & foods -> ideas, religious practices, and diseases)

As the Abbasid Caliphate declined, new Islamic political entities emerged, most of which were dominated by Turkish Peoples.
Ex. Seljuk and Ottoman Empires

Governance in Dar al-lslam
Before 1450
Islamic states developed innovative methods of rule.
Ex. Slave soldiers

Turkic states emerged as the Abbasid Caliphate disintegrated and used slave soldiers to maintain their power.

#### Common Threads:

- Turkic states such as the Seljuk Empire, the Mamluk Empire of Egypt, and the Sultanate of Delhi were able to use slave soldiers to expand their territory and help spread Islamic rule in Afro-Eurasia.
- Islamic states increasingly relied on methods of warfare that originated among nomadic peoples in the Eurasian steppes to expand and maintain their power.

The spread of technology is through the trade routes.

- Innovations:
  - First book on algebra
  - Encyclopedia ot medicine
  - Hospitals and traveling clinics
  - Science and philosophy
  - Poetry and calligraphy
  - Astronomy and architecture
  - Universities and libraries
- Transfers:
  - Translated Greek literature into Arabic
  - Studies mathematics texts from India
  - Adopted techniques for paper making from China

#### Common Threads:

- Technological advances and innovations will continue to shape human development and interactions throughout the entire course.
- States and empires will continue to encourage significant intellectual innovations and transfers.

## SAQ Example:

A. Identify ONE technological transfer between world regions that affected state power in the period 1450—1750.
B. Explain ONE similarity in the way that technology affected state power in Asia and in the way that technology affected state
power in Europe in the period 1450—1750.
C. Explain ONE difference in the way that technology affected state power in Asia and in the way that technology affected state power in Europe in the period 1450—1750.

## DBQ Example:

Evaluate the extent to which railroads affected the process of empire-building in Afro-Eurasia between 1860 and 1918.

## LEQ Example:

In the period 600 to 1450 C.E., trade networks expanded and economic productive capacity increased. Technological innovations and transfers often contributed to this process.
Develop an argument that evaluates the extent to which technological innovations or transfers led to increased economic growth in this period.

The disintegration of the Abbasid state resulted in the emergence of numerous Islamic states controlled by Turkic peoples. Long before the collapse of the Abbasid Caliphate in 1258, the Islamic world split into a number of smaller successor states, most of which were dominated by Turkic ruling classes. In the thirteenth century, some examples of such states included the Delhi Sultanate of India and the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt.

The activities of Sufi missionaries were the largest factor in the further spread of Islam across Afro-Eurasia in the period 1200–1450, as Sufis won new converts in places such as Anatolia, Central Asia, India, and Southeast Asia where Islam had already been introduced.

In the Abbasid caliphate, the caliph held supreme religious and political authority, which best illustrates the Abbasid concept of governance regarding religion and political power.
