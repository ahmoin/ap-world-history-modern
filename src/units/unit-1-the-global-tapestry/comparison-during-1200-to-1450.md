## A good thesis must...

- Fully address the prompt and only the prompt
  - (seriously, answer the prompt)
- Provides organizational categories that will be used in the essay; each category should correspond to a paragraph
  - (usually 2 or 3 works well)
- Easiest way to do it is rearrange the prompt and add your categories
  - (make sure to include the time period and region)

## Example prompts with thesis statements

  - Thesis: Labradors make the best pet, because while they do tend to shed a lot, they are loyal and loving.
