## State Building in General

state building - how societies create organized governments and keep them running â€” especially between 1200 and 1450.

### Why do we have states?

- A) Organization of resources
- B) Enforcement of social norms/laws

### How do they keep power?

- A) Use of religion
- B) Keeping the economy running and wealth flowing in

## How did states in the Americas gain and keep power?

- A) Using religion to govern (i.e. Aztecs (in today's southern Mexico) use of human sacrifice)
  - Human sacrifices also shows the political and military strength of the empire, sacrified people were often prisoners of war
  - Human sacrifices not only show religious beliefs but also lets the emperor show off his power
- B) Facilitating long-distance trade (i.e. Incan road system)

Geography limited state expansion in the Americas more than Afro-Eurasia (Andes Mountains and rainforests in Central America)

We don't really see a huge empire in the Americas like we see in Africa and Asia. Like the Incas are geographically narrow due to the Andes mountains. The Aztecs are also geographically narrow due to the rainforests in Central America. The Americas are not as conducive to large empires as Afro-Eurasia.
