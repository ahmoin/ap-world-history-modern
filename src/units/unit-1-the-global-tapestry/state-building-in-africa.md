# State Building in Africa

In Africa, state systems demonstrated continuity, innovation, and diversity and expanded in scope and reach.

By the 12th century, Ethiopia was an island of Christianity on the continent of Africa surrounded by Islamic states. Separated from the Roman Catholic Church in Europe, Ethiopian Christianity developed independently. New rulers ordered the building of churches with Ethiopian architechture. It was a distinct form of the faith that combined traditional practices of ancestor worship and animism with Christian beliefs.

Most sub-Saharan African states expanded through a combination of local and regional factors. Sub-Saharan African states were also geographically remote from Europe and did not need European assistance to expand their territories. However, some African states were able to maintain diplomatic and cultural contacts with the broader Afro-Eurasian world.

Even after the initial development period (1200-1450) and despite the barrier of the Sahara desert, African states such as Ethiopia and the states of the Sahel (Ghana, Mali, Songhai, etc.) were able to maintain regular diplomatic and cultural contacts with states in North Africa, Mediterranean Europe, and Muslim Southwest Asia.

Sahel is the savanna region of Africa that lies between the Sahara desert to the north and the tropical savanna to the south. The Sahel is a transitional zone between the desert and the more humid regions of West Africa. It is characterized by a semi-arid climate, with seasonal rainfall and a mix of grasslands, shrubs, and scattered trees. The Sahel has historically been an important area for trade and cultural exchange, connecting North Africa with sub-Saharan Africa.

Some African states’ religious traditions continued to be influenced by cultural transfers dating back to earlier centuries. Especially in Ethiopia, Ethiopia provides a good example of a cultural continuity—Christianity—being used as the basis for state building in Africa. Christianity became widespread among the Ethiopian population and was adopted by Ethiopian political elites as early as the fourth century c.e. Similar examples of a cultural continuity influencing the development of African states would be the influence of Islam in West African states such as Ghana and Mali and in the Swahili states of East Africa in the period 1200–1450. Islam had been introduced to those regions centuries earlier as well.

Many premodern African states and societies were characterized by various degrees of religious syncretism, but Ethiopia was Christian and its population’s beliefs were not a mixture of several different religions. Ethiopia is a good example of cultural continuity as its religious traditions continued to be influenced by cultural transfers from earlier centuries.

Like almost all rulers throughout history, African rulers used both religious claims and their role as lawgivers or law enforcers to bolster their political legitimacy.
