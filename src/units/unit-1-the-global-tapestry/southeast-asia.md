## South/Southeast Asia Culture

- Hindu beliefs lead to caste system
- Buddhism begins in South Asia, but becomes popular elsewhere
- Turkic invaders spread Islam to South Asia, but it doesn't become very popular; more popular in SE Asia
- This mixture of religions leads to other practices, like Sufism

## South Asia Governance

- India as we know it was not unified; many different Hindu and Muslim kingdoms
- Typically, Muslim-led in the north (like the Delhi Sultanate)
- Hindu-led in the south (like the Vijayanagar Empire)

Hindiusm and Buddhism are Vedic religions. Being free of physical desires in order to concentrate on spiritual pursuits is a key belief of Vedic religions such as Buddhism and Hinduism. The fact that the passage refers to the king as being free from all physical desire in the context of praising him for dedicating a statute to a bodhisattva and of being “an ocean of all virtues practiced by the followers of the Buddha” indicates that the phrase is used in this religious sense of the phrase.
