## Should we call this the Dark Ages?

- Why we should not:
  - Things are going well in the rest of the world
  - Agriculture and trade begin to increase by 1200
  - Centralized governments are beginning to form (European countries are starting to look like the ones we know today)
  - New technologies from Asia (gunpowder, compass, lateen sails)
- But ...
  - Urbanization and trade are still well behind the rest of the world
  - Many Europeans are farmers tied to the land through serfdom

## Feudalism

Without a centralized government, who is going to protect the people and
resources?
Feudalism emerges to solve this problem

- Serfs farm the land for lords in exchange for protection
- Lords swear allegiance to kings (usually the most powerful lord) for land and gifts from war

Feudalism eventually fades away (1200 - 1450) because of new technologies and farming techniques, the Black Death, and more centralized government bureaucracies.

Like most European states at the time, the English monarchy had to contend with the power of an entrenched hereditary nobility and a semiautonomous clerical establishment. While the monarch’s power was absolute in theory, in practice he or she often needed to wield it in cooperation or consultation with the aristocracy and the clergy.

While fourteenth-century England had a parliament, the monarch remained the ultimate political authority, as was the case in virtually all other states in medieval Europe.
The practice of the ruler consulting with the nobility and the clergy before making political decisions was not part of the Roman political legacy.
Like most medieval legislation, decreeing is expressed in Christian religious terminology, which is best reflected in the king’s and archbishop’s titles in "I, Edward, by the grace of God king of England, sent this decree to the reverend father in Christ William, by the grace of God archbishop of Canterbury, supreme Church leader of all England".
The process of decreeing reflects the fragmented, decenralized nature of European feudal monarchies.

Guild regulations concerning maximum work hours did exist in medieval Europe, but they generally applied to craftspeople, not to agricultural workers.
In the context of manorialism, feudal lords had numerous venues for taking legal action and, sometimes direct coercive action, against uncooperative workers and serfs. Edward’s decree can be seen as reinforcing the feudal lords’ rights to take such action. The sense of urgency behind the labor shortages reflects the agrarian nature of medieval economies.
The sense of urgency behind the labor shortages of agricultural workers, particularly ploughmen, reflects the agrarian nature of medieval economies, and the mention of serfs reflects the reliance of medieval economies on coerced labor.
